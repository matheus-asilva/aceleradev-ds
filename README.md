### Week 1:
The main goal of this week is showing all the frameworks to develop a career as a Data Scientist. You can find the topics below:
* [Springer Texts in Statistics:](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/~dias/Intoduction%20to%20Statistical%20Learning.pdf) Here we can find one of the most important material to learn the foundations of Machine Learning, in such a statistical approach. 
* [Machine Learning Step-by-Step:](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/) Article written by Jason Brownlee showing us how to start solving a problem using Machine Learning techniques step-by-step.
* [How to Become a Data Scientist: The Definitive Guide:](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/08/become-data-scientist-definitive-guide.html) Article written in KDNuggets showing the roadmap to become a Data Scientist, giving courses and links for each step.
* [Building Data Science Teams:](http://www.datascienceassn.org/sites/default/files/Building%20Data%20Science%20Teams.pdf) E-book written by DJ Patil sharing the whole process to begin a Data Science Team. Here we can find the roles of a data scientist, products, risks, services and the full context about having a successful team.
* [Intro to Data Science - Numpy and Pandas:](https://towardsdatascience.com/intro-to-data-science-part-1-numpy-and-pandas-49d98740661b) Article to show an introduction of these frameworks. Mostly how to handle with data using numpy and dataframes with pandas.
* [Jupyter Notebook Best Practices:](https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-notebook-best-practices-f430a6ba8c69) First steps using Jupyter Notebooks to develop a data science project and this article gives some hacking productivity tips.
* [Deploy Machine Learning Models in Production as APIs:](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/machine-learning-models-as-apis-using-flask/) This tutorial shows how to deploy a model in production using Flask end-to-end to develop a API.
* [Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems:](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems.pdf) Paper explaining Machine Learning risk factors to account for in the system design.
